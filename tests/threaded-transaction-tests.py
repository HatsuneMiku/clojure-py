"""threaded-transaction-tests.py

These tests exercise the LockingTransaction code
in some multithreaded ways. More comprehensive testing
than the tests in ref-tests.py, which test at a more
granular level.

# Basic idea: We want to test the corner cases when different transactions that happen concurrently on different
# threads run into each other at a specified time. e.g. if Transaction 1 (T1) does an in-transaction-write of Ref 1 (R1)
# and Transaction 2 (T2) that was started later tries to do a write on R1, T2 should be retried.

# In order to test cross-thread behaviour this granularly we need a bit of leg-work.
